Bad B Compiler is a work-in-progress compiler for B programming language and my attempt to understand the concepts of working on a programming language.

For now, this compiler can only generate tokens (without support for assignments - e.g. =+).

## Quick Start
```bash
make
./bbc examples/simple.b
```
